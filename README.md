# ChatGPT Market Positioning & Segmentation  
**Arizona State University | Feb 2025 – Mar 2025**

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzed ChatGPT’s competitive positioning versus DeepSeek, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude. Using perceptual mapping and stated preference analysis, we assessed consumer perceptions, identified distinct user segments, and simulated market-share outcomes for hypothetical entrants.

## 📊 Data & Methodology  
- **Survey Instrument:** Google Forms (39 cleaned responses, 1–9 scale)  
- **Perceptual Data:** 6 brands × 6 attributes  
  - Ease of Use, Speed, Accuracy, Range, Innovation, Trustworthiness  
- **Analytics:**  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA (2 dimensions retained, 99.8% variance explained)  
  - **Modeling & Visualization:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Enginius for interactive reports  
- **Reporting:** Jupyter Notebooks, PDF, and PowerPoint

## ✨ Key Findings  

### Primary Dimensions  
- **Dim 1:** Ease of Use & Speed of Response (99.5%)  
- **Dim 2:** Accuracy & Innovation (0.3%)  

### Brand Positioning (Dim 1 vs. Dim 2)  
- **ChatGPT (0.900, −0.012):** clear leader on usability & speed  
- **Others:** DeepSeek (−0.140, 0.040), Gemini (−0.225, 0.001), Copilot (−0.096, 0.010), Claude (−0.439, −0.039)  

### Consumer Preferences  
- **Mean Ratings:**  
  - ChatGPT: **7.74**  
  - Copilot: 4.18  
  - Gemini: 4.08  
  - DeepSeek: 3.92  
  - Claude: 3.46  
- **Segments Identified:**  
  - *Segment 1:* Open to alternatives (preferences 5.1–7.4)  
  - *Segment 2:* Highly loyal to ChatGPT (avg 8.19)  

### Market Simulation  
- A hypothetical neutral entrant could capture **~7.2% market share** under a first-choice rule.
